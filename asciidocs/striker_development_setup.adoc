== Setup for the Striker Developement

=== Set the Force Role for Testing
Under `./home/configurations/simrobot/head/robot3/`, there is a json file with the following content.

[source,json]
----
{
  "forceRole": "none"
}
----

For testing purposes the role for the simulation robot can be changed to the striker role by replacing the "none" by "striker".

=== Run the Simrobot Setup

In the project root run the following command.

[source,sh]
----
./scripts/midas setup simrobot
----

=== Compile the Simrobot
Execute the following command to compile the simrobot

[source,sh]
----
./tools/SimRobot/build_simrobot
----

The compiled files will be stored under `./tools/SimRobot/build/`
== Running and Compiling the Striker

=== Compile the Project

[source,sh]
----
./scripts/midas compile develop simrobot
----

=== Start the Application
Execute the following command to start the simrobot

[source,sh]
----
./tools/SimRobot/build/SimRobot
----

This will open a SimRobot Window.You can choose one of the available maps in the scene folder under `./tools/SimRobot/scenes/`.These Maps use different simulation robots.As one can see in step one robot 3 has been forced to role striker.Since map `1Player.ros2` defines the robot 3 as the only player we select this map for testing the striker.

=== Mate
With mate one can debug the striker with values delivered by the robot.One can also view the StrikerAction for the Striker with it's values.

Start Mate with the following command

`./tools/mate/start.sh`

If it won't work the checkout the readme under the mate directory.

With mate you can connect using the following path `/tmp/simrobot/robot3`.

== Striker Structure
The striker consists of three files.

=== Striker Action
This file is located under `./src/tuhhsdk/Data/DucksStrikerAction.hpp`.

This file is a data container for all the states the Striker is currently in.

=== Striker Action Provider
This file is located under
`./src/brain/Behavior/DucksStrikerActionProvider.hpp`
with the cpp file under
`./src/brain/Behavior/DucksStrikerActionProvider.cpp`

This C++ class provides the Striker Action.It contains the basic behavior.What should it do in certain scenarios?

=== Striker
This file is located under `./src/brain/Behavior/DucksBehaviour/Roles/Striker.hpp`

This File will use the Striker Action and will run the necessary commands.
